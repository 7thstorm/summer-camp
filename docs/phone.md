## Dial Pad

This is the main view of the phone the user will see after login. Users can enter a phone number with the dialpad buttons or with a cursor click on the phone display and then entering a number with the keyboard.

The `+` is automatically added to every phone number. Phone numbers are not checked for validity, users can dial phone numbers if the lenght is greater than 6 characters. After pressing the green `call` button the call is connected.
